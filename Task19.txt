Say we want to have notifications feature in the system. Then very probably that we will need a basic functionality
for handling notifications. This could be some "AbstractNotificationService" with common methods for handling notifications.
Then we want to have a more specialized version say "SmsNotificationService" or even "EmailNotificationService". They do not
introduce any new global capabilities and rather restrict the usage to some concrete scenario. For example SmsNotificationService
would inherit the general notification capabilities and then specialize them to send over sms.

Whereas a "AnalyticsNotificationService" which would introduce new methods for performing analytics of the sent notifications is
an example of extension inheritance. The superclass does not have the operations such as "TrackDeliveryStatus" or similar. Probably this
service can even include thorough composition the sending method itself and we could choose the sending method like "Sms" or "Email"
polymorphically.
